# SPRING-BOOT-REST-API-TEST
## REST API with Spring Boot for test 
### Includes embeed H2 Database, embeed Tomcat server, documentation with Swagger 2

### Prerequisite And Demo App

To use this project, you are going to need;

    Java JDK 8 (1.8) 
    Gradle compatibile with JDK 8
    Any Java IDE (IntelliJ)
    Postman tool (optional, will be used for testing web service)

We are going to build a demo app named as test-api. This will be a simple web service with basic CRUD operations. I'm going to demonstrate default and external configuration, how to use multiple implementation and autowire them within the code and outside the code with an external configuration file. Our app will be a standalone application that we can use independently, and we are going to use an embedded tomcat, an embedded H2 database.

See Swagger documentation at:
